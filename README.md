## Project Description
This repository was created in order to test our analysis skills using datasets in pandas and creating visualization tools

In this analysis we collected data for each borough of New York City and examined trends from 2010-2020 with 5 different variables:
Rental Pricing
Income
Gender
Age
Ethnicity

##Analysis
Using the visualization tools created our team will see if there is any corelation between rentail prices in NYC and income levels and how the increase in rent impacts the demographics of NYC.

##Sources
Data was pulled from Census as well as Street Easy

##File Description
The project was created using Jupyter notebooks using Pandas,Matplot, Numpy modules
It can run and be viewed in any source code editor or in the Git Repository
